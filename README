/** BIG WHAT **/

Most people don't understand that QRCodes can be used for much more than "scanning links".
They can contain encoded data of pretty much anyform.

Imagine if you could transfer not just a link, but an entire story in the flickr of a few seconds. Or perhaps not just words, but actual logic, working code.
"Everyone point your phone at the screen, and we will start the download."

Mass, broadcast distribution of software through visual media. 
Blipvert, Snowcrash...this idea has existed before in fiction. 
Now is the time to make it real.

/** HOW TO MAKE **/
Feed any text file in the script/qranime.sh script

> scripts/qranime.sh mygreatnovel.txt

and out you will receive a mygreatnovel.txt.gif animation

/** HOW TO READ **/

1) Install the Android Barcode Scanner app

2) Enable the "Bulk Mode" scanning under Menu->Settings

3) Activate and point the scanner at the animated code for awhile.

4) Press the Menu->History option to read the collected lines of text
